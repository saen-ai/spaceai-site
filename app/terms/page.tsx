        <h3>4.1 Free Tier</h3>

          <li>
            All paid subscriptions are managed and processed through the Apple
            App Store or Google Play Store, depending on your device platform.
          </li>
          <li>

            unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your

          <li>
            Each AI generation (redesign, paint, furnish, remove, stage,
            landscape, upscale, or replace) consumes a certain number of credits.
            The credit cost may vary depending on the complexity of the edit type
            and the output resolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Credits are allocated based on your subscription tier and refresh at
            the start of each billing cycle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unused credits do not roll over</strong> to the next billing
            period. Any remaining credits at the end of a billing cycle will
            expire.
          </li>
          <li>

            We reserve the right to modify credit allocations, costs, and
            refresh rates with reasonable notice to users.

          If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or
          unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
