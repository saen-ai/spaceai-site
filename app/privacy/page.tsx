        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          SpaceAI (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;)
          operates the SpaceAI mobile application (the
          &ldquo;App&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy explains what personal
          information we collect, how we use and share it, and the choices you
          have regarding your data. By using SpaceAI you agree to the
          collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If
          you do not agree with the terms described here, please do not use the
          App.
        </p>

        {/* 2. Information We Collect */}
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Account Data</h3>
        <p>
          When you create an account we collect your email address, display
          name, and profile photo. You may register using Google Sign-In, Apple
          Sign-In, or a traditional email and password combination. If you use
          a third-party sign-in provider we receive only the authentication
          token and basic profile information that you authorize.
        </p>

        <h3>Room Photos</h3>
        <p>
          SpaceAI allows you to capture new photos with your device camera or
          select existing images from your photo library. These room photos are
          uploaded to our servers so that our AI models can analyze and
          transform them into new design concepts.
        </p>

        <h3>Design Preferences</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the design wizard you provide preferences such as interior
          style selections, mood choices, room type classifications, and any
          special instructions or notes. These preferences are used to guide
          the AI generation process and are stored alongside your projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Generated Content</h3>
        <p>
          We store the AI-generated design images and room analysis results
          that are produced on your behalf. This includes detected room
          attributes, furniture inventories, lighting assessments, and the
          final rendered design images.
        </p>

        <h3>Usage Data</h3>
        <p>
          We collect information about how you interact with the App, including
          which features you use, the types of edits you perform (redesign,
          paint, furnish, remove, stage, landscape, generate, upscale, or
          replace), the number of generations you run, and the credits you
          consume.
        </p>

        <h3>Device Data</h3>
        <p>
          We automatically collect certain technical information from your
          device, including device type and model, operating system and
          version, app version, and language and locale settings. This data
          helps us diagnose issues and optimize performance across different
          devices.
        </p>

        <h3>Payment Data</h3>
        <p>
          Subscription purchases are processed entirely by RevenueCat and the
          respective app store (Apple App Store or Google Play). We receive
          your subscription status, plan type, and purchase history from
          RevenueCat. We do not collect, process, or store your payment card
          details, billing address, or other financial information.
        </p>

        {/* 3. How We Use Your Information */}
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>AI Room Analysis and Design Generation:</strong> We use
            your room photos, design preferences, and special instructions to
            perform AI-powered room analysis and generate personalized design
            concepts tailored to your selections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscription and Credit Management:</strong> We use your
            account and payment data to process subscriptions, allocate design
            credits, and enforce usage limits associated with your plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized
            usage data helps us improve our AI models, refine design quality,
            and develop new features. We may use de-identified data to train
            and evaluate model performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Notifications:</strong> We send push notifications to
            inform you when your AI-generated designs are ready for review, as
            well as occasional updates about new features or changes to your
            account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics:</strong> We analyze feature usage patterns to
            understand which tools are most valuable, identify areas for
            improvement, and make informed product decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* 4. How Your Photos Are Processed */}
        <h2>4. How Your Photos Are Processed</h2>
        <p>
          Your room photos go through the following pipeline:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Local Compression:</strong> Before any data leaves your
            device, photos are compressed locally to a maximum dimension of
            1280 pixels and encoded as JPEG at 70% quality. This reduces file
            size and upload time while preserving sufficient detail for
            accurate AI analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Upload:</strong> Compressed images are transmitted
            over TLS-encrypted connections and stored in our secure cloud
            storage infrastructure powered by Supabase. Each image is placed in
            a private storage bucket accessible only to your authenticated
            account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI Analysis:</strong> Our backend passes your photos to AI
            vision models that detect the room type, identify furniture and
            fixtures, assess lighting conditions, and evaluate the existing
            style. This analysis informs the design generation process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design Generation:</strong> Your photos, combined with your
            selected style, mood, and special instructions, are used as inputs
            for AI design generation. The resulting images are stored in your
            account alongside the originals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retention:</strong> All uploaded photos and generated
            designs remain in your account until you choose to delete them.
            Deleting a project or individual image permanently removes it from
            our storage.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* 5. Third-Party Services */}
